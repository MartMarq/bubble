Watchface for Watchy (SQFMI) - Bubble

there is a time adjustment routine in Uhr.cpp

every day at 0:30 it sets back time by 15 seconds and 500 ms, because my Watchy runs too fast. Just delete it (or set another adjustment)

You can circle through the watchface by pushing the right buttons. This part of the watchface shows the average of todays steps and the number of steps of the last 6 days.
